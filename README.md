# Lasso and Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression:

Key Idea: Introduces a penalty term to the cost function that penalizes the sum of the squared coefficients in the model. This encourages the model to have smaller coefficients, leading to a simpler and more generalizable model.
Impact: Shrinks all coefficients towards zero, reducing their individual impact but not necessarily eliminating any.
Strengths: More stable than Lasso, good for correlated features, works well when many irrelevant features are present.
Weaknesses: Might not perform as well as Lasso in feature selection, coefficients remain non-zero even with strong regularization.

Lasso Regression:

Key Idea: Introduces a penalty term to the cost function that penalizes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients in the model. This encourages the model to set some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.
Impact: Can set some coefficients to zero, leading to sparser models with fewer features.
Strengths: Performs automatic feature selection, can be more effective than Ridge in high dimensional settings with many features.
Weaknesses: More sensitive to outliers and noisy data, unstable coefficient selection with small changes in regularization parameter.
Choosing between Ridge and Lasso:

Use Ridge Regression: When feature selection is not a priority, when there are many correlated features, or when data is noisy.
Use Lasso Regression: When feature selection is important, when dealing with high dimensionality, or when interpretability is desired through fewer features in the final model.
